/**
* ALBRIT BENDO
* Write a function void itobs(unsigned int no, char âˆ— str), which receives an unsigned
* integer and a character pointer as parameters. The function should convert an unsigned integer
* into its binary string representation, therefore it determines the pattern of 1s and 0s of theun-
* signed integer and puts this into the string.
* Then write a program that repeatedly reads an unsigned integer from the keyboard that is passed
* to itobs(). Then the program prints the resulting string from the main function to standard
* output.
